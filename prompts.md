# General

The current project is a monorepo containing 3 Minecraft plugins and a shared SDK:

- `sdk`
- `bukkit`
- `bungeecord`
- `velocity`

These are the ingest API for MCMetrics, a software service that provides metrics for Minecraft servers. The plugins collect data about Minecraft player behavior and send it to the MCMetrics API.
